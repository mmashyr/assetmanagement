Suggestions:
1) Add integration tests
2) We should think about using some UUID for transaction requests to avoid double processing
3) Using a db instead of map in prod, controlling transactions by spring + db locks
4) Add general codestyle checks + static analysis/coverage plugins, establish a CD env
